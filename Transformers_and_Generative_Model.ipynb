        "\n",
        "* **High-performance multidimensional arrays:** These are the fundamental data structure in NumPy. They allow efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data.\n",
        "* **Mathematical functions:** A vast collection of functions for operations on arrays (e.g., linear algebra, Fourier transforms, random number generation).\n",
        "* **Broadcasting:**  A mechanism that enables arithmetic operations between arrays of different shapes, promoting code conciseness.\n",
        "* **Tools for integrating with other languages:** NumPy can interface with code written in C/C++ and Fortran, allowing you to leverage existing libraries.\n",

        "* **Convenience:**  NumPy provides a wide range of built-in functions for mathematical and scientific operations, simplifying your code.\n",
